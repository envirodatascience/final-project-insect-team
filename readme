## How does insect richness in Connecticut correlate with temperature and precipitation over time?

Project Statement: 
Insects, particularly beetles (Coleoptera), butterflies (Lepidoptera), and bees (Apidae) are important pollinators and predators, contributing to food security
and ecosystem stability. Populations have declined over recent decades, thus we seek to assess the relationship between climate changes and insect species richness.

Hypothesis:
Changes in temperature and precipitation over the past 50 years have significantly influenced the distribution and population density of Nymphalidae species in Connecticut.
