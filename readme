Project statement: Nymphalidae insect family
Butterflies beyond being beautful creatures are major pollinators of the worldâ€™s wild and domesticated flowering plants, and all stages of their life cycle are important in food security and ecosystem stability. Alarmed by the decreasing number of butterflies and the ever increasing climate change impacts, we are very concerned about the future. Hence, we seek to examine the relationship between some climatic factors -specifically temperature and precipitation- and the distribution of Nymphalidae speciess across U.S. states over the past 50 years.

Hypothesis:
Changes in temperature and precipitation over the past 50 years have significantly influenced the distribution and population density of Nymphalidae species across U.S. states.

Research Questions:
How have changes in temperature across U.S. states over time affected the appearance and distribution of the Nymphalidae insect species?
How have changes in precipitation across U.S. states over time affected the appearance and distribution of the Nymphalidae insect species?
How has the geographic distribution of specific insect orders or families changed across U.S. states over time?
