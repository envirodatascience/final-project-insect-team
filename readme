Project statement: Nymphalidae insect family
Climate change poses a significant threat to butterfly populations, disrupting their habitats, food sources, and migration patterns, ultimately leading to declines in certain species. 

Dataset: https://www.gbif.org/dataset/96404cc2-f762-11e1-a439-00145eb45e9a/activity

Research Questions:
How have changes in temperature across U.S. states over time affected the appearance and distribution of the Nymphalidae insect species?
How has the geographic distribution of specific insect orders or families changed across U.S. states over time?
